Reseller Account Startup
========================

Upon activating your Reseller account with LogicBoxes, you need to make the following settings within your Reseller Control Panel to begin selling Products to your Customers and Sub-Resellers:

Select your Selling Currency
----------------------------

At the time of sign-up, you must carefully select your desired Selling Currency. Your Selling Currency is the currency in which you wish to sell your Products and Services to your Customers and Sub-Resellers.

Add Funds in your Reseller Account
----------------------------------

To let your Customers and Sub-Resellers buy Products and Services through you, you need to add and maintain sufficient funds in your Reseller Account with Liquid. 

If the need arises, you may modify the Selling Currency as long as there are no transactions performed within your Reseller Account.
