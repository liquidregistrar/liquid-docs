Creating Demo Reseller Account
==================================

To understand and evaluate the interfaces and API we provide, you can use the Demo interface.

To create a fresh Demo Reseller account:

1. Visit http://blabla
2. Fill up the form, and follow the steps thereafter to set up your Reseller account (make sure you provide an accurate email address).
3. Login to your Demo Reseller Account from http://blabla
4. Once you have logged in, click on My Billing and then click Add Funds to add Funds to your Account. You cannot test out some of the features of the Demo Account without adding funds to your account.
5. You might wish to start with checking the flexibility and features of the system by referring to the Reseller Account Startup Guide.

.. note::
	The demo account may not function at all times, since some beta testing is also done on the demo account. Also, the demo account is reset every day. All orders placed in the demo account would be automatically deleted every 24 hours.
