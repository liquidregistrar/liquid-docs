At the time of sign-up, you must carefully select your desired Selling Currency. Your Selling Currency is the currency in which you wish to sell your Products and Services to your Customers and Sub-Resellers.

	2. Go to menu Settings -> Manage Products and Pricing -> Manage TLDs
	3. Here, you may choose to either:
		:Sell: To sell this TLD to your Customers and Sub-Resellers.

	4. Click the Edit button under the Manage Prices column, for the TLD whose pricing you need to set.
	5. On the next page, set your selling prices as per your business requirements. You could:
		- Set different prices for each action, i.e. Registration, Renewal, Transfer and Restore.
		- Set reducing price for each year to offer multi-year discounts. This way, you can offer increased discounts as and when your Customers register / renew domain names for more than the typical one year.
		- Set discounts for the minimum duration and nominal prices for every subsequent tenure, etc.

	
Configure your Website
----------------------

You may use our free ready-made private labeled websites for all your retail business.

It is recommended that you undertake the following on your private labeled websites to improve your Customer's experience:

	- Brand the URL
	- Customize the Header and Footer
	- Specify the Additional Payment Options for your Customers/Sub-Resellers

To manage your website:
	1. Login to your Reseller Control Panel
	2. Go to menu Settings -> Branding Settings
	3. You could modify the logo, social media accounts and web contents from the branding settings page.

Use our REST APIs to integrate with your own website
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you are already selling several other Products and Services to your existing clients through another interface/Control Panel and do not want to add the burden of introducing the new Control Panels to them, you could use our REST APIs to integrate provisioning and management of these Products and Services in your existing interfaces and Control Panels.

See :ref:`restapi-label` page for more detail.

WHMCS Integrations
------------------

If you already using WHMCS billing software, you could easily install our registrar module to integrate liquid to your whmcs billing software. 

See :ref:`whmcs-label` page for more detail.

Configure your Payment Collection Options
-----------------------------------------

Currently we provide 2 payment methods, wire transfer and paypal (including Credit card, amex, etc via paypal).
Please setup the payment collection options:

	1. Login to your Reseller Control Panel
	2. Go to menu Settings -> Payment Gateway
	3. Click Edit button on the right.
	4. Complete the payment gateway configuration form, and click save.
	5. Repeat number 3 and 4 to modify other payment gateway.

Create Company Users
--------------------
Create independent Control Panel logins for your staff in various departments (like Sales, Billing, Support), to enable them to effectively manage your business.

Thus, you can enable the Billing User to List Transactions, Add Funds, etc., but not be able to changes the Name Servers of the domain name and so on. In effect, User creation would help you to assign fixed roles to persons of your company and assigning them different responsibilities to reduce your own workload.

You can add Company Users from within the Reseller Control Panel as mentioned below:
	1. Login to your Reseller Control Panel
	2. In the menu, click Settings -> User Management
	3. Click Add User Button
	4. Complete the form, and click Save button
